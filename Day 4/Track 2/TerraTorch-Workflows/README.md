# Hands-on Session: Building Scalable AI EO Workflows 

Earth Observation FMs are widely available, but turning them into workflows that fit real tasks and constraints remains resource-intensive. This workshop focuses on modular EO workflows that make it easier to adapt foundation models and EO tools to your own tasks, datasets, and research goals.

---
## Overview
This hands-on session introduces EO embedding workflows, downstream adaptation, and scalable experimentation with TerraTorch and TerraTorch Iterate through interactive notebooks and real-world examples.

- Generate embeddings from pretrained EO foundation models 
- Train lightweight downstream decoders 
- Explore a forest disturbance monitoring workflow 
- Run scalable HPO/NAS experiments with TerraTorch Iterate


## What You Will Learn

- Flexible spatial and temporal EO embedding aggregation strategies
- Decoder-only downstream adaptation on precomputed embeddings 
- Zero-invasive experiment configuration with TerraTorch Iterate 
- Efficient experiment tracking and comparison

## Materials

- `requirements.txt`: Package list for the workshop environment.
- `00_setup_check.ipynb`: Environment and data checks.

**Hands-on material**:
- `01_TerraTorch_Embeddings/`: Notebook and sample YAML file for embedding generation.
- `02_TerraTorch_Downstream/`: Notebook and sample YAML file for downstream tasks.
- `03_Embed2Scale_Usecase/`: Notebook for data exploration and downstream workflows.
- `04_TerraTorch_Iterate/`: TerraTorch Iterate workflows for scalable experimentation.

## Set-Up

Before starting the hands-on notebooks, run:

```text
00_setup_check.ipynb
```

This checks the Python environment, key package imports, GPU availability, and
whether a shared data path is available.

### Fallback

If no pre-configured image/kernel is available, participants need to install
the requirements manually:

```bash
pip install -r "Day 4/Track 2/TerraTorch-Workflows/requirements.txt"
```

### Workshop data — `03_Forest_Disturbance_Monitoring`

The forest-disturbance notebook reads a ~15 GB data bundle that ships
separately from this repo. Download and unzip it from the workshop S3
bucket before launching the notebook (~5 minutes total):

```bash
# Download and unzip the data for 03_Forest_Disturbance_Monitoring
# May take about 5 minutes in total
cd ~
aws s3 cp s3://enw-04241552-kx1nks-shared/data/workshop_bundle.zip .
unzip -q workshop_bundle.zip -d workshop_data
```

This produces `~/workshop_data/workshop_bundle/{data,audit}/`. The
notebook's Section 0 auto-detects this path on the SageMaker VM; see
the comments in the Setup cell to override via `WORKSHOP_DATA_ROOT` if
you unzipped the bundle elsewhere.
